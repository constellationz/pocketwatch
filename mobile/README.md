# Getting started

Before anything else, install the required dependencies with `npm install`.

Then, use these commands to run the mobile development servers:

```bash
npm run android
```

```bash
npm run ios 
```

```bash
npm run web
```

## Note for MacOS

To use the iOS emulator, install Xcode from the App Store.
